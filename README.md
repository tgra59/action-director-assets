I need the actual image file content in base64 format to upload it. Since I can't directly read your local file, here are two options:

## Option 1: Manual Upload (Easiest)
1. Go to: https://github.com/tgra59/action-director-assets
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag your "action director.png" file
4. Rename it to "action-director-banner.png" (no spaces)
5. Click "Commit changes"

## Option 2: Base64 Upload
If you can convert your image to base64, I can upload it directly.

Once uploaded, the URL will be:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tgra59/action-director-assets/main/action-director-banner.png
